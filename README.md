# Stock Watch Bot

- A Discord bot that fetches and displays real-time stock information using yfinance. Simply use the `!stock [ticker]` command to get details like the previous close, opening price, day's range, and P/E ratio in a neat, embedded format.

- I needed an easy, fast, and efficient way to complete my daily stock tracker for my High School's Economy class.
